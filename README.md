LOAN DATA EXPLORATION

DATASET:
The loan data was obtained from [LendingClub.com](www.lendingclub.com). Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.

Lending club had a [very interesting year in 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club#2016), so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.

The lending data from 2007-2010 was used to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. The Data has already been preprocessed and the null values have been cleaned.
the data set contains 9578 lonas with 14 variables on each loan including credit policy, interest rate, installment, log annual income and a few others.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
The goal of this project is to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full using Random Forest Classifier model and Decision Tree classifier and to evaluate which model performs best.
